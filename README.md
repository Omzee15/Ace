Animatronic Head with Realistic Eye Movements and Face Tracking
Overview

This project is a realistic animatronic head capable of natural eye and eyelid movements that dynamically track and follow a user's face. Using computer vision and servo-controlled mechanisms, the system replicates human-like gaze behavior, making it ideal for robotics, human-computer interaction, and AI-driven character animation.
Features

    Face Tracking: Uses OpenCV and deep learning for real-time face detection and tracking.
    Realistic Eye Movement: Smooth pupil and eyelid movements synchronized to mimic human expressions.
    Head and Eye Coordination: The system follows the user's face, making gaze interactions natural.
    Servo-Controlled Mechanism: Precision servo motors drive the movement of the eyes and eyelids.
    Modular & Customizable: Designed with 3D-printed components, making it adaptable for different applications.

Technologies Used

    Computer Vision: OpenCV for real-time face detection
    Microcontroller: Arduino/Raspberry Pi for servo control
    Programming Languages: Python & C++
    3D Printing: Custom-designed eye and eyelid mechanisms
