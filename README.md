Animatronic Head with Realistic Eye Movements and Face Tracking
Overview

This project is a realistic animatronic head capable of natural eye and eyelid movements that dynamically track and follow a user's face. Using computer vision and servo-controlled mechanisms, the system replicates human-like gaze behavior, making it ideal for robotics, human-computer interaction, and AI-driven character animation.
Features


Technologies Used : 

1. Computer Vision: OpenCV for real-time face detection
2. Microcontroller: Arduino/Raspberry Pi for servo control
3. Programming Languages: Python & C++
4. 3D Printing: Custom-designed eye and eyelid mechanisms
